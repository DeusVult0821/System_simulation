For this project we wanted to recreate the solar. So to recreate the solar system we diveded the work in parts.
To introduce our project we asked our self, what we can do for our project that is original and intresting.
Then we think that we are in the era of new tecnology, that we are triying to go out of our planet. 
We think that the best think to do is to recreate the solar system.
Is not a easy job but also not that hard. Using tools like diagrams and pygame we recreate our solar system
